## Description
The site allows the user to sign in or sign up as a new user, then start a workout activity and log in the date, exercise, duration, and weight (if any) used.  The information is stored into a Mongo DB that the user can review in a User Dashboard.  New activities or exercises need to be entered before recording them into the Workout database.  

## Visuals
The User Dashboard displays the user's profile info along with their activity history and detailed activity log information.
